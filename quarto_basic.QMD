## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. All Quarto files in RStudio use the `.qmd` file extension.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. The document can be rendered in HTML (viewable in a web browser), a pdf, or even a Word document. You can embed code like this:

<!--# Use the shortcut CTRL+ALT+I to insert a code block. Specify the type of code you are typing by changing the attributes. -->

```{r}
1 + 1
```

<!--# The type of code you insert is very flexible but it should be specified. -->

You can add options to executable code like this

<!--# Some popular options to try: echo, eval, label, fig-cap, fig-align, fig-width, fig-height, fig-pos. -->

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Plots

You can add plots to your Quarto documentation:

<!--# Click on the green play button to run just this particular code block. -->

<!--# Clicking on the grey down button executes all the code blocks before it. -->

```{r}
#| label: fig-basicplot
data(cars)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

We can clean up this plot and make it look nicer. Because this requires quite a bit of R code, we should hide it.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-pos: ht
#| fig-cap: "Distance versus Speed Relationship of 50 cars from the 1920s."
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| label: fig-cars
#| echo: false
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, main="Distance versus Speed",
     sub="The cars Dataset", xlab="Speed", ylab="Distance",
     pch=16, col="red")
```

Here's an example of how to use R results within your document: The average speed of all these cars is `r round(mean(cars$speed),1)` mph. When you click on Render, this R code will be replaced with the correct result, rounded to 1 decimal place.

Use \`r\` to insert inline R code. For example, `r round(median(cars$dist),2)` ft. is the median distance. This is handy if your data set changes but the *result* needed here stays the same.

## Tables

Here's an example of a simple table:

|          |  n  |             Mean              |             Median              |
|-------------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Distance | 50  | `r round(mean(cars$dist),2)`  | `r round(median(cars$dist),2)`  |
| Speed    | 50  | `r round(mean(cars$speed),1)` | `r round(median(cars$speed),1)` |

: The Cars Table {#tbl-cars}

We can cross-reference within the document. For example, compare the mean and median from the table to @fig-cars. Notice the label `fig-cars` was specified in the R code block above. When we Render the document, we can then reference the plot. The reference stays with the plot, even if it gets moved. Try this by moving the R code block of the plot before @fig-basicplot and click on Render again - the Figure label of the two plots should get switched.

Tables can be tricky to cross-reference. The `tbl-ref` goes at the end of the table caption. See the Source side. We can then reference the table, @tbl-cars once we click on Render like we did with the plot.

Figures, Tables, Equations, Headings, References can be cross-referenced in this way. For example, let $F$ be the antiderivative of a function $f$:

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx = F(b)-F(a)
$$ {#eq-FTC}

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is given by @eq-FTC.
